## Summary
Clarified that there is no need for a separate stores architecture as currently implemented. Chroma DB provides a unified interface, and different data types should be split by their "workspaces" or collections within Chroma, each supporting different or granular embeddings.

## Updated Plan
1. Evaluate the current implementation of the separate stores architecture.
2. Transition the architecture to utilize Chroma DB's unified interface.
3. Define the workspaces or collections in Chroma for different data types.
4. Implement the necessary changes in the codebase to reflect this architecture.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The architecture is simplified by removing the separate stores implementation.
- Chroma DB is utilized effectively to manage different data types through workspaces or collections.
- Each workspace or collection supports the required different or granular embeddings as needed.
- Documentation is updated to reflect these changes clearly.
